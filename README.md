## About this Application:
- Banana Scoreboard allows users to search through a scoreboard, by user's name and sees where the user searched ranks amongst the top ten highest banana scores. This application also features sorting by seeing all the rankings for all users, as well as sorting alphabetically and by lowest ranked. If user types in a name of a partial match, the application will offer suggestions that match the closest in the data.

## Context:
- This application was created within a 2 week guideline for a takehome challenge, using React Native and Redux. The goal of this application was to show my knowledege of React Native and Redux, as well as testing Redux logic. UI design and implementation were completely up to me, as long as it had all the required features.

## Additional Information: 
- <a href="https://github.com/users/sakisandrac/projects/11">Github Project Board</a> was utilized to create issues, including user stories and acceptance criteria for testing. Issues were closed with Pull Requests.
- I used Figma to design the UI of the application, as well as FlatIcon to source icons/images used. <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/yYY3i88AwwelHKRk99UnCJ/Banana-Scoreboard?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=zfTXmjO6ZPd6emKu-1">Figma Design file here</a>
